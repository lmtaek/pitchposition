 ## Getting Started/Using Pitch Position
 - Click link to the project demo at the top of the README.md page. 
 - Allow Pitch Position to load. 
 - Allow Pitch Position permissions to your webcam. If you deny it permissions, the application will not have the information necessary to produce sound. You can refresh the page, and approve camera permissions if you originally decline these permissions.
 - Stand up if you are seated, and take a few steps away from your computer. Pitch Position is trying to find your features.
 - Pitch Position will indicate it is successfully running when sounds begin to be produced. Having limbs in view of the camera will cause the application to produce sounds.
 - Move around! Pitch Position will change its sound output depending on your positioning of limbs and body.
